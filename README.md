## Methods for PDE

1. Crank Nicolson -- Finite Differences  Filip 
2. Monte Carlo Jasper
3. Chang-Cooper Jasper
4. Spectral Method Pietro


### Notes on what seems important to them:

- justifying the choices we make i.e. step size, forward vs backward differences
- should we do adaptive mesh refinement?
- we need to explain the dimensions of the plot and what the numbers mean

# Slides

  1) ### Title

  2) ### Determistic Article:
     
     Why this model
     
     Explaining equations
     
  3) ### Plots of deterministic w different starting conditions:
     
     brief, also numerical methods here !eliminating some paths cause they go to zero
  
  4) ### Adding noise:
   
     explain why a stochastic, and why only on phi

     how to add this to the original equations

     and numerical
 
  5) ### Show average in manypaths stochastic

     2 different D

     choose aboute the final D, physical meaning and plankton layer
  
  6) ### FP theory
  
     from SDEs to FP
  
  7) ### Our langevin to FP
  
     splitting the differential operator advection + diffusion
  
  8) ### Crank - Nicolson
  
     just show the generic scheme, briefly proprietes of CN and why we use it
  
  9) ### Chang Cooper
  
     same but more theory to explain it
     
     cite the article
  
  10) ### Comparing all 4 results
  
      we already said that SDE and FP should be the same

      deterministic + langevin + CN * CC
  
  11) ### Conclusions
   
      comparing the three different methods

      use langevin lol

      if we can conclusion on the physics
