## Methods for PDE

1. Crank Nicolson -- Finite Diffeences  Filip 
2. Monte Carlo Jasper
3. Chang-Cooper Jasper
4. Spectral Method Pietro


### Notes on what seems important to them:

- justifying the choices We make i.e. step size, forward vs backward differences
- should we do adaptive mesh refinement?
- we need to explaine the dimensions of the plot and what the numbers mean
